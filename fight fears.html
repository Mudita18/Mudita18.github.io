		Here are some ways discussed to fight your fears.<br>
		<ol>

			<li>Take time out : It's impossible to think clearly when you're flooded with fear or anxiety. The first thing to do is take time out so you can physically calm down.
	    	</li>
	    	<li>Breathe through panic : If you start to get a faster heartbeat or sweating palms, the best thing is not to fight it.Stay where you are and simply feel the panic without trying to distract yourself. Place the palm of your hand on your stomach and breathe slowly and deeply.
			</li>
			<li>Imagine the worst : Try imagining the worst thing that can happen â€“ perhaps it's panicking and having a heart attack. Then try to think yourself into having a heart attack. It's just not possible. The fear will run away the more you chase it...
